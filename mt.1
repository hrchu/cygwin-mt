.SH NAME
mt \- control magnetic tape drive operation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mt
[\-V] [\-f device] [\-\-file=device] [\-\-version]
operation [count]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR mt .
.B mt
performs the given
.IR operation ,
which must be one of the tape operations listed below, on a tape
drive.
.PP
The default tape device to operate on is taken from the file
.I /usr/include/sys/mtio.h
when
.B mt
is compiled.  It can be overridden by giving a device file name in
the environment variable
.BR TAPE
or by a command line option (see below), which also overrides the
environment variable.
.PP
The device must be either a character special file or a
remote tape drive.  To use a tape drive on another machine as the
archive, use a filename that starts with `HOSTNAME:'.  The
hostname can be preceded by a username and an `@' to access the remote
tape drive as that user, if you have permission to do so (typically an
entry in that user's `~/.rhosts' file).
.PP
The available operations are listed below.  Unique abbreviations are
accepted.  Not all operations are available on all systems, or work on
all types of tape drives.
Some operations optionally take a repeat count, which can be given
after the operation name and defaults to 1.
.IP "eof, weof"
Write
.I count
EOF marks at current position.
.IP fsf
Forward space
.I count
files.
The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.
.IP bsf
Backward space
.I count
files.
The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.
.IP fsr
Forward space
.I count
records.
.IP bsr
Backward space
.I count
records.
.IP bsfm
Backward space
.I count
file marks.
The tape is positioned on the beginning-of-the-tape side of
the file mark.
.IP fsfm
Forward space
.I count
file marks.
The tape is positioned on the beginning-of-the-tape side of
the file mark.
.IP asf
Absolute space to file number
.IR count .
Equivalent to rewind followed by fsf
.IR count .
.IP eom
Space to the end of the recorded media on the tape
(for appending files onto tapes).
.IP rewind
Rewind the tape.
.IP "offline, rewoffl"
Rewind the tape and, if applicable, unload the tape.
.IP status
Print status information about the tape unit. `status 2' and `status 3' print
more information.
.IP retension
Rewind the tape, then wind it to the end of the reel,
then rewind it again.
.IP erase
Erase the tape.
.IP fss
(SCSI tapes) Forward space
.I count
setmarks.
.IP bss
(SCSI tapes) Backward space
.I count
setmarks.
.IP "wset"
(SCSI tapes) Write
.I count
setmarks at current position (only SCSI tape).
.IP "eod, seod"
Space to end of valid data.  Used on streamer tape
drives to append data to the logical and of tape.
.IP setblk
(SCSI tapes) Set the block size of the drive to
.I count
bytes per record.
.IP setdensity
(SCSI tapes) Set the tape density code to
.I count.
The proper codes to use with each drive should be looked up from the
drive documentation.
.IP drvbuffer
(SCSI tapes) Set the tape drive buffer code to
.I number.
The proper value for unbuffered operation is zero and "normal" buffered
operation one. The meanings of other values can be found in the drive
documentation or, in case of a SCSI-2 drive, from the SCSI-2 standard.
.IP stoptions
(SCSI tapes) Set the driver options bits to
.I count
for the device.
The bits can be set by oring the following values: 1 to enable write
buffering, 2 to enable asynchronous writes, 4 to enable read ahead,
8 to enable debugging output (if it has been compiled to the driver).
.IP stwrthreshold
(SCSI tapes) The write threshold for the tape device is set to
.I count
kilobytes. The value must be smaller than or equal to the driver
buffer size.
.IP seek
(SCSI tapes) Seek to the
.I count
block on the tape.  This operation is available on some
Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.
.IP tell
(SCSI tapes) Tell the current block on tape.  This operation is available on some
Tandberg and Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.
.IP densities
(SCSI tapes) Write explanation of some common density codes to
standard output.
.IP "compression, datcompression"
(some SCSI-2 DAT tapes) Inquire or set the compression status
(on/off). If the
.I count
is one the compression status is printed. If the
.I count
is zero, compression is disabled. Otherwise, compression is
enabled. The command uses the SCSI ioctl to read and write the Data
Compression Characteristics mode page (15). ONLY ROOT CAN USE THIS
COMMAND.
.IP "setpart, setpartition"
Change active partition on tape drives supporting them. A
.I count
of 0 means to position the tape in the default partition.
.IP partseek
The tape position is set to block
.I count
in the partition given by the argument after count. The default partition
is 0.
.IP "mkpart, mkpartition"
Creates tape partitions on tape drives supporting them.  Creates one partition
if
.I count
is 0, two partitions otherwise.  For drives supporting initiator
partitions,
.I count
is the size of the second partition in megabytes.  For drives only supporting
select or fixed partitions,
.I count
just specifies if one (count = 0) or two (count > 0) partitions are created.
.PP
.B mt
exits with a status of 0 if the operation succeeded, 1 if the
operation or device name given was invalid, or 2 if the operation
failed.
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
.I "\-f, \-\-file=device"
Use
.I device
as the file name of the tape drive to operate on.
To use a
tape drive on another machine, use a filename that
starts with `HOSTNAME:'.  The hostname can be preceded by a
username and an `@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if
you have permission to do so (typically an entry in that user's
`~/.rhosts' file).
.TP
.I "\-V, \-\-version"
Print the version number of
.BR mt .
